/**
 * Global concurrency limiter for camera HTTP traffic.
 *
 * The Luna's embedded HTTP server is single-connection and low-capacity. Each
 * gallery tile has its own IntersectionObserver that fires a download the moment
 * it nears the viewport, so a screen of tiles would otherwise launch ~16
 * transfers at once — saturating the camera and starving every request (photos,
 * RAW, and video thumbnails alike). The reference app (luna-ai-cut) caps all
 * camera-facing traffic at 2 concurrent transfers via a priority queue; we do
 * the same here.
 *
 * The slot is held for the WHOLE transfer — fetch AND body read — because the
 * camera connection isn't free until the body has been consumed. Callers pass a
 * function that does both. A task's priority may be a fixed number or a function
 * re-evaluated every time the queue picks the next task, so a grid thumbnail can
 * report how close it is to the viewport *now* — that's what makes loading
 * follow the scroll instead of the order tiles happened to mount.
