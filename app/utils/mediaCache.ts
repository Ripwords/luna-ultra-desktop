/**
 * Session-lifetime LRU cache for camera media.
 *
 * Every media component fetches from the camera on its own IntersectionObserver
 * and drops the result on unmount, so scrolling a tile out of the grid and back
 * re-downloads it over the camera's slow Wi-Fi — and opening full-screen
 * re-fetches a file the grid already pulled. This cache keeps the *derived*
 * artifact (a display-ready Blob, or a decoded RAW data URL) keyed by source, so
 * a repeat view costs no network and no camera-queue slot.
 *
 * Deliberately memory-only: it is empty on app start. The multi-MB source
 * buffer behind a RAW is never cached, only the small preview derived from it.
 *
 * Eviction is by recency, not frequency. Gallery access is scroll-driven, so a
 * tile just scrolled past is far likelier to return than one viewed ten times
 * earlier; frequency counting would also let early views pin entries forever.
 *
 * Evicting an entry can never blank a rendered <img>: an object URL keeps its
 * blob alive independently of this cache's reference.
