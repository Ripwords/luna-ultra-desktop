/**
 * Watches for the camera going silent mid-session. Only transport failures
 * count: a thrown fetch (timeout, refused connection, Wi-Fi gone). Any
 * completed HTTP response, including a 404 for a missing file, proves the
 * camera is answering and resets the count, so one bad file can never end a
 * working session.
 *
 * Reaching the threshold is not proof on its own: a single large download that
 * retries and drops three times can get there while the camera is perfectly
 * healthy. So the threshold only triggers a cheap probe request, and the
 * session is dropped only when that probe also fails.
 *
 * The probe is injected rather than imported so this module stays pure: no
 * Vue, no Nuxt, no fetch, unit-testable under a plain node environment.
